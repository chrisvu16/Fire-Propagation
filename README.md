# Overview
This project simulates wildfire propagation using a probabilistic model that accounts for topography. The model explores how varying slope sensitivity factors influence the spread of fire across a landscape. The primary goal is to understand and visualize the impact of terrain on fire behavior, which can help in developing better wildfire management strategies.

# Features
- Simulates fire spread using a probabilistic approach.
- Incorporates terrain elevation to model uphill and downhill fire propagation.
- Uses a sigmoid function to determine the probability of fire spread based on slope.
- Visualizes fire spread over time with various slope sensitivity factors.
